          <p>About 200 open cast mining and quarrying centers in Udaipur, about half of which are illegal
            are involved in stone mining including soapstone, building stone, rock phosphate and dolomite.
            The mines spread over 15,000 hectares in Udaipur have caused many adverse impacts on environment.
            About 150 tones of explosives are used per month in blasting. </p>
